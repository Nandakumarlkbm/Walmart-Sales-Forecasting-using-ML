# Walmart-Sales-Forecasting-using-ML

One challenge of Walmart in retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. We are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions.

In addition, Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this competition is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data.
 
 Walmart has 45 stores and each store has 99 departments. We have data of weekly sales of each Store-Department pair from 2010–02–05 to 2012–11–01 and we have to predict weekly sales of each store-department pair from 2012–11–02 to 2013–07-26.
